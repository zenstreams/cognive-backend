Agentic AI Ops Platform
Detailed Requirements Document (PRD)
This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Agentic AI Ops Platform. It is intended to serve as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for engineering, architecture, and business stakeholders.
1. Goals & Objectives
The primary goal of the Agentic AI Ops Platform is to provide enterprises with centralized visibility, governance, and cost control over autonomous AI agents operating across teams and environments.
Key objectives include:
• Establish a single source of truth for all AI agents
• Enable operational observability without disrupting agent execution
• Enforce cost and usage governance
• Support enterprise security and audit requirements

2. Scope Definition
2.1 In Scope (MVP)
• Agent registry and metadata management
• Agent execution tracking and lifecycle management
• Cost calculation and budget enforcement
• Python SDK for agent integration
• Web-based dashboard for monitoring and reporting

2.2 Out of Scope (Phase 2+)
• Building agent logic or workflows
• Fine-grained policy engines (context-aware rules)
• Multi-cloud deployment automation
• Prompt engineering or optimization tools

3. User Personas
• AI Platform Engineer – Integrates and maintains agent infrastructure
• Enterprise Architect – Defines governance and architectural standards
• Engineering Manager – Tracks usage, failures, and performance
• Security / Risk Officer – Reviews audit trails and compliance

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Agent Registry
The system shall allow users to register AI agents with the following attributes:
• Agent name and unique identifier
• Framework used (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, Custom)
• Owning team and environment
• Allowed LLM providers and models
• Approved tools and data sources
• Budget constraints (per-run, daily)

4.2 Agent Execution Tracking
The system shall track the lifecycle of every agent run, including:
• Run start and end timestamps
• Execution status (success, failure, terminated)
• Step-level execution metadata
• LLM calls and tool invocations
• Error and failure details

4.3 Cost Management & Budget Enforcement
The platform shall calculate token usage and monetary cost per agent run. It shall support budget thresholds and enforce hard stops when limits are exceeded.
4.4 Dashboard & Reporting
The web dashboard shall provide:
• Agent inventory and ownership views
• Cost trends by agent, team, and model
• Execution success and failure metrics
• Drill-down into individual agent runs

4.5 SDK Requirements
The Python SDK shall:
• Register agents programmatically
• Start and end agent runs
• Emit execution and cost events asynchronously
• Fail gracefully without blocking agent execution

5. Non-Functional Requirements
• Scalability: Support thousands of agents and millions of runs
• Availability: Control plane uptime of 99.9%
• Performance: SDK overhead < 5% latency
• Security: Encryption in transit and at rest
• Data Privacy: No prompt storage by default

6. Security & Compliance Requirements
The platform shall provide:
• Role-based access control (RBAC)
• Immutable audit logs
• Secure API authentication
• Optional PII redaction

7. Success Metrics
• Time to onboard first agent < 30 minutes
• Cost visibility coverage > 95%
• Reduction in agent-related incidents
• Enterprise customer adoption and renewal rates

8. Dependencies & Risks
Dependencies include reliable LLM provider cost data and customer SDK adoption. Risks include framework fragmentation and evolving enterprise AI regulations.
