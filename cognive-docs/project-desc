Agentic AI Ops Platform
(Internal AI Agents Manager)
This document provides a detailed product description for the Agentic AI Ops Platform, an enterprise-grade control plane designed to manage, govern, and operate autonomous AI agents within large organizations.
1. Product Overview
The Agentic AI Ops Platform acts as a centralized control plane for AI agents built using frameworks such as LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom Python-based implementations. It does not replace agent frameworks; instead, it provides operational visibility, governance, cost control, and security across the entire agent ecosystem.
2. Problem Statement
As enterprises adopt agentic AI, multiple teams independently build and deploy AI agents. This results in fragmentation, lack of visibility, uncontrolled costs, and security risks. Organizations struggle to answer basic operational questions such as which agents are running, what tools they access, how much they cost, and whether their behavior complies with enterprise policies.
3. Target Customers
• Enterprise AI Platform Teams
• CTOs and Chief Architects
• AI Governance and Risk Teams
• Fintech, SaaS, Consulting, and Regulated Industries

4. Core Capabilities
4.1 Agent Registry
A centralized registry that serves as the system of record for all AI agents. Each agent is tracked with metadata including ownership, framework, versioning, allowed tools, approved models, and budget limits.
4.2 Execution Tracking & Observability
The platform captures structured execution metadata for every agent run, including step-level traces, LLM calls, tool invocations, latency, and failure reasons. This enables debugging, performance optimization, and compliance auditing.
4.3 Cost Management & Governance
Built-in cost accounting tracks token usage and spend across models, agents, teams, and environments. Organizations can define per-run and per-day budgets with automatic enforcement and alerting when thresholds are breached.
4.4 Security, Access Control & Auditability
The platform enforces which agents can access which tools, data sources, and LLMs. All actions are logged with immutable audit trails, enabling traceability for regulatory and security reviews.
4.5 Replay & Debugging
Agent runs can be replayed using stored execution metadata. This allows teams to analyze failures, validate outputs, and demonstrate compliance without exposing raw prompt data.
5. Architecture Overview
The platform follows a control-plane / data-plane architecture. Agents execute within customer-controlled infrastructure, while the SaaS control plane handles metadata, policies, cost tracking, and visualization. This approach ensures enterprise-grade security, privacy, and scalability.
6. SDK & Integration Model
A lightweight Python SDK enables rapid adoption. The SDK registers agents, starts and ends runs, intercepts LLM calls, and asynchronously emits execution events to the control plane. The design is framework-agnostic and resilient to network failures.
7. MVP Feature Scope
• Agent registry and metadata management
• Agent run tracking and execution logs
• Cost calculation for major LLM providers
• Python SDK for agent integration
• Web-based dashboard for visibility

8. Business Value
The Agentic AI Ops Platform enables enterprises to safely scale AI agent usage by providing governance, transparency, and cost control. It reduces operational risk, accelerates debugging, and aligns AI initiatives with enterprise compliance and financial objectives.
9. Pricing & Commercial Model
The platform is sold as an enterprise SaaS offering with pricing based on the number of agents, execution volume, and required governance features. Annual enterprise contracts are the primary commercial model.
10. Strategic Differentiation
Unlike agent frameworks or developer-only observability tools, the Agentic AI Ops Platform is designed from the ground up for enterprise operations, governance, and security. It positions itself as a foundational layer in the enterprise AI stack.
